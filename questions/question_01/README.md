# üìå Question 1: Information Gain for CreditScore Split

## üîç Problem Overview
In this task, we analyze whether splitting on `CreditScore = 650` is an optimal decision for constructing a decision tree to classify loan risk levels. By calculating the **information gain (IG)**, we will determine if this attribute should be chosen as the root node.

## üè∑Ô∏è Methodology
To evaluate the effectiveness of this split, we follow these key steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Compute Parent Node Entropy
Entropy measures the impurity of a dataset and is calculated using:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}H(S)=-\sum_{i=1}^{c}p_i\log_2(p_i)" alt="Entropy Formula">
</div>

where ![p_i](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}p_i) represents the proportion of each class (High Risk or Low Risk).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Split Data and Compute Child Node Entropy
- Divide the dataset into two groups:  
  - `CreditScore ‚â§ 650`
  - `CreditScore > 650`
- Compute entropy for each subset using the same formula:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}H(S_i)=-\sum_{j=1}^{c}p_j\log_2(p_j)" alt="Subset Entropy Formula">
</div>

where ![S_i](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}S_i) represents each subset created by the split, and ![p_j](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}p_j) denotes the proportion of class \( j \) in subset \( S_i \).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate Information Gain (IG)
Information Gain quantifies how much entropy is reduced after the split:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}IG=H(S)-\sum_{i=1}^{k}\frac{|S_i|}{|S|}H(S_i)" alt="Information Gain Formula">
</div>

where  
- ![S_i](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}S_i) represents each subset,  
- ![|S_i|](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}|S_i|) denotes the number of samples in subset \( S_i \),  
- ![|S|](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}|S|) is the total number of samples before the split.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Decision Analysis
- **Higher IG** ‚Üí The split is effective, making `CreditScore` a strong candidate for the root node.
- **Lower IG** ‚Üí The split is weak, and other attributes (e.g., `Age` or `Education`) should be considered.

## üìä Expected Outcome
By computing IG, we will determine if `CreditScore=650` provides the best split for the root node. If the gain is insufficient, alternative features should be evaluated.
